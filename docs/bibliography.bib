  abstract = {Metabolic Flux Analysis (MFA) has emerged as a tool of great significance for metabolic engineering and mammalian physiology. An important limitation of MFA, as carried out via stable isotope labeling and GC/MS and NMR measurements, is the large number of isotopomer or cumomer equations that need to be solved, especially when multiple isotopic tracers are used for the labeling of the system. This restriction reduces the ability of MFA to fully utilize the power of multiple isotopic tracers in elucidating the physiology of realistic situations comprising complex bioreaction networks. Here, we present a novel framework for the modeling of isotopic labeling systems that significantly reduces the number of system variables without any loss of information. The elementary metabolite unit (EMU) framework is based on a highly efficient decomposition method that identifies the minimum amount of information needed to simulate isotopic labeling within a reaction network using the knowledge of atomic transitions occurring in the network reactions. The functional units generated by the decomposition algorithm, called elementary metabolite units, form the new basis for generating system equations that describe the relationship between fluxes and stable isotope measurements. Isotopomer abundances simulated using the EMU framework are identical to those obtained using the isotopomer and cumomer methods, however, require significantly less computation time. For a typical 13C-labeling system the total number of equations that needs to be solved is reduced by one order-of-magnitude (100s EMUs vs. 1000s isotopomers). As such, the EMU framework is most efficient for the analysis of labeling by multiple isotopic tracers. For example, analysis of the gluconeogenesis pathway with 2H, 13C, and 18O tracers requires only 354 EMUs, compared to more than 2 million isotopomers.},

  abstract = {Quantitative and qualitative knowledge of metabolic rates (i.e. fluxes) over a metabolic network and in specific cellular compartments gives insights into the regulation of metabolism and helps to understand the contribution of metabolic alterations to pathology. In this review we introduce methodology to resolve metabolic fluxes from stable isotope labeling and relevant techniques in model development, model simplification, flux uncertainty analysis and experimental design that together is termed metabolic flux analysis. Finally we discuss applications using metabolic flux analysis to elucidate mechanisms pertinent to tumor cell metabolism. We hope that this review gives the readers a brief introduction of how flux analysis is conducted, how technical issues related to it are addressed, and how its application has contributed to our knowledge of tumor cell metabolism.},
