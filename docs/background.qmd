# Elementary Metabolite Units (EMU): a novel framework for modeling isotopic distributions

Reference: @antoniewiczElementaryMetaboliteUnits2007a

This paper introduces the EMU method for solving the forward MFA problem (i.e.
finding the mass isotopomer distributions for a given set of fluxes).

# Data

[This
notebook](https://github.com/biosustain/incawrapper/blob/main/docs/examples/Published_data_examples_C_necator.ipynb)
has data and processing by Viktor and Matthias. [The
repository](https://github.com/biosustain/incawrapper/) also has a lot of other
datasets and useful information and code.
