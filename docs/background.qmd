# Elementary Metabolite Units (EMU): a novel framework for modeling isotopic distributions

Reference: @antoniewiczElementaryMetaboliteUnits2007a

This paper introduces the EMU method for solving the forward MFA problem (i.e.
finding the mass isotopomer distributions for a given set of fluxes).

# Viktor and Matthias's incawrapper package

[This
notebook](https://github.com/biosustain/incawrapper/blob/main/docs/examples/Published_data_examples_C_necator.ipynb)
has data and processing for a typical MFA problem. [The
repository](https://github.com/biosustain/incawrapper/) also has a lot of other
datasets and useful information and code.

# Understanding metabolism with flux analysis: From theory to application

Reference: @daiUnderstandingMetabolismFlux2017

This is a review paper covering metabolic flux analysis in general.

# Input data for a 13C MFA experiment

Input data consists of:

* A description of the metabolic network, including:

  * Stoichiometric coefficient of each compound in each reaction

  * Atom transitions of each reaction, i.e. given the arrangement of labellable
  atoms on one side of the reaction, what is the arrangement on the other side.

* Description of the labelled compounds added to the experiments, or "tracers".
i.e. a list including the following information for each tracer:

  * compound id

  * positions of labelled atoms

  * purity, i.e. for each position, the proportion of atoms in that position
  that were labelled

* Specification of which tracers were used in which experiments, and with what
enrichment level (i.e. what proportion of each tracer's compound was the
tracer.)

* Direct flux measurements, i.e. ones that did not require labelling. For each measurement:

  * reaction id
  * experiment id
  * measured flux
  * measurement error

* Mass isotopomer distribution measurements. For each measurement:

  * experiment id
  * compound id
  * fragment id
  * mass isotopomer id (i.e. 0, 1, 2, ...)
  * measured intensity (i.e. proportion of total fragment intensity)
